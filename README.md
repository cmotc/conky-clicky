Interactive Conky
=================

This is a library for creating interactive Conky configurations where one can
click on an area of text and trigger an interactive effect. I mostly plan to use
it to show and hide information and launch shell scripts in a terminal. It's
based on [this](http://crunchbang.org/forums/profile.php?id=3813) Crunchbang 
forum's post by MrPeachy([source code from post here](https://github.com/cmotc/conky-clicky/blob/merge-upstream/conky-clicky.example.lua)), but with cairo parts replaced with conky only parts. Once this one is done, 
I'll also create a few text-only widgets and effects for use with it. Buttons 
and maybe a tree or something.
